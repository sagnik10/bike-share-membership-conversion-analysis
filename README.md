## Analysis Performed

The analysis focused on identifying behavioral differences between rider types.

Key analysis areas:

Ride Duration Analysis:

* Average ride duration
* Median ride duration
* Distribution comparison

Temporal Analysis:

* Usage by day of week
* Usage by hour of day
* Monthly usage patterns

Behavioral Analysis:

* Commuter vs leisure behavior
* Peak riding periods
* Rider frequency patterns

Comparative Analysis:

* Casual vs Member ride behavior
* Ride duration differences
* Usage timing differences

---

## Key Insights

Major findings from the analysis include:

Casual Riders:

* Take longer rides on average
* Ride more frequently on weekends
* Show leisure-oriented usage patterns
* More active during mid-day hours

Annual Members:

* Take shorter rides on average
* Ride more frequently on weekdays
* Show commuter-oriented patterns
* Peak usage during morning and evening commute hours

Behavioral Differences:

* Members use bikes for transportation
* Casual riders use bikes for recreation

These patterns provide clear opportunities for targeted marketing.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Recommendation 1:
Target casual riders with weekend membership promotions.

Rationale:
Casual riders are highly active during weekends and represent strong conversion potential.

Recommendation 2:
Introduce commuter-focused incentives for casual riders.

Examples:

* Discounted membership trials
* First-month commuter discounts
* Commuter reward programs

Recommendation 3:
Use behavioral targeting in marketing campaigns.

Examples:

* Personalized offers
* Location-based promotions
* Time-based marketing campaigns
